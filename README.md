This program aims to design a Hangman game.

Hangman is a game where the objective is to guess a word by figuring out which letters it contains.

The rules are simple: the player has 9 attempts to guess the word by entering letters. If the player makes a 

mistake, the Hangman figure is gradually drawn. If the player correctly guesses the word, they win the game.

To launch the program, execute the command: go build -o hangman main/main.go puis ./hangman words.txt
